Plot tutorial
*******************

MeteoInfoLab has a collection of command style functions that make MeteoInfoLab work like MATLAB.
Each plot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., create a figure, create a plotting area
in a figure, plot some lines in a plotting area, decorate the plot with lables, etc....
MeteoInfoLab is stateful, in that it keeps track of the current figure and plotting area, and the
plotting functions are directed to the current axes.
