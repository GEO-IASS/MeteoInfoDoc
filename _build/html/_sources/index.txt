Introduction
=====================================

MeteoInfo is a freely available software designed to view and analyze meteorological and
spatial data interactively. Some GIS functions were developed from ground level. It has two
editions: Java and C#. MeteoInfo may be run in Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Unix. MeteoInfo can
also be run automatically using MeteoInfo scripting with the IronPython language (C# edition)
or Jython language (Java edition). The main functions are packed in the MeteoInfo class library,
which could be used to conveniently develop the software.
