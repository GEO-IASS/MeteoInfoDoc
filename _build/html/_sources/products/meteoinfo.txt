MeteoInfo
*******************

MeteoInfo is a freely available software designed to view and analyze meteorological and spatial 
data interactively. Some GIS functions were developed from ground level. It has two editions: 
Java and C#. MeteoInfo may be run in Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Unix. MeteoInfo can also be run 
automatically using MeteoInfo scripting with the IronPython language (C# edition) or Groovy 
language (Java edition). The main functions are packed in the MeteoInfo class library, which could 
be used to conveniently develop the software.
